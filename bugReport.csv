Failed Test Case ID,Summary,Steps to Reproduce,Expected Result,Actual Result,Notes
7,A user is able to send POST request to /hash with incorrect parameters,"curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8088/hash/3' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --data-raw '{""username"":""jawsomejess""}'",400 bad request,200 OK and a job id is generated (3) and a hash was also created as a result (z4PhNX7vuL3xVChQ1m2AB9Yg5AULVxXcg/SpIdNs6c5H0NE8XYXysP+DGNKHfuwvY7kxvUdBeoGlODJ6+SfaPg==),For this test I used username instead of password but the software treated it as though it were a password and hashed it instead of rejecting it.
10,A user is able to send POST request to /stats,"curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8088/stats' \ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \ --data-raw '{""password"":""testnumber2""}'",405 method not allowed,"200 OK {""TotalRequests"":4,""AverageTime"":1529660}",I’m expecting the service to outright reject a POST request to this endpoint. Currently it’s treating it as though it’s a GET request.
13,The software is not doing a graceful shutdown as according to the acceptance criteria provided. The software should reject any new requests while the shutdown is pending.,"1. xargs -I % -P 10 curl --location --request POST 'localhost:8088/hash' --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{""password"":""Testing123""}' < <(printf '%s\n' {1..400})
2. curl -X POST -d 'shutdown' http://localhost:8088/hash","200 OK, software allows any in-flight hashing to complete, software rejects any new requests",200 OK 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334353637383940…,The software is continuing to accept new requests while it is pending shutdown. If the requests are a bit slower (2s) it does have time to shutdown properly.
