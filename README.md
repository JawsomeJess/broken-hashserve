## Test Cases

Test cases are located in the testCases.csv file. 
They include testing steps as well as test execution and results. 
I included the happy path cases which cover what was listed in the acceptance criteria 
as well as several negative and exploratory cases to try and find any odd bugs not covered in the AC.

## Bug Report

The bug report is located in the bugReport.csv file.
They include steps to reproduce the issue, expected and actual results, as well as the original test case ID

## Postman

A postman collection has also been included as extra.
Postman can be downloaded from https://www.postman.com/downloads/
Once Postman is downloaded you can import this collection by going to import > file.
Once the collection is imported you can click on the arrow next to the collection and select run.
Postman does not allow for multiple connections to run in parallel so this collection does not cover all the test cases.
